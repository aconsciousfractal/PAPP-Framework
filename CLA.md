## Grant of Rights

### 1. Copyright License

You hereby grant to the Project Maintainer and to recipients of software distributed by the Project Maintainer a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to:

- Reproduce Your Contributions
- Prepare derivative works of Your Contributions
- Publicly display Your Contributions
- Publicly perform Your Contributions
- Sublicense Your Contributions
- Distribute Your Contributions and such derivative works

### 2. Patent License

You hereby grant to the Project Maintainer and to recipients of software distributed by the Project Maintainer a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to:

- Make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work
- Apply to any patent claims licensable by You that are necessarily infringed by Your Contribution(s) alone or by combination of Your Contribution(s) with the Work

If any entity institutes patent litigation against You or any other entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that Your Contribution, or the Work to which you have contributed, constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to that entity under this Agreement shall terminate.

### 3. Relicensing Rights

**You grant the Project Maintainer the right to relicense Your Contributions** under any open source or proprietary license in the future, including but not limited to:

- Dual licensing (GPL v3 + commercial license)
- License updates (e.g., GPL v3 to GPL v4)
- Alternative open source licenses (MIT, Apache 2.0, etc.)

**Rationale**: This allows the Project Maintainer to:
- Offer commercial versions with warranty and support
- Adapt to future licensing needs
- Maintain copyright control for patent protection

**Your rights**: Your Contribution remains available under GPL v3 in the public version. You retain copyright and can use your own code elsewhere.

## Your Representations

You represent that:

1. **Ownership**: You are legally entitled to grant the above licenses. If your employer(s) has rights to intellectual property that you create, you represent that:
   - You have received permission to make Contributions on behalf of that employer, OR
   - Your employer has waived such rights for your Contributions

2. **Originality**: Each of Your Contributions is Your original creation. If any part is not Your original creation, you submit it separately with complete details of its source and license.

3. **No Conflicts**: Your Contribution does not, to the best of your knowledge, violate any third party's intellectual property rights.

4. **Notification**: You agree to notify the Project Maintainer if you become aware of any facts or circumstances that would make these representations inaccurate.

---

## Contribution Terms

1. **GPL v3 Public License**: All Contributions will be licensed to the public under GNU GPL v3 (or later) unless explicitly stated otherwise by the Project Maintainer.

2. **Attribution**: You will be credited as a contributor in the project's contributor list and relevant documentation.
