# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and maintainers pledge to make participation in the PAPP project a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

- Being respectful and considerate
- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Focusing on what is best for the community and the project

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- Harassment, discrimination, or exclusionary conduct
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Publishing others' private information without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior they deem inappropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, and it also applies when an individual is officially representing the project in public spaces (e.g., issues, pull requests, discussions).

## Enforcement

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, please report it.
